Roberta
RoBERTa stands for "Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach." It is a large language model (LLM) based on the Transformer architecture, which was first introduced in the paper "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" by Jacob Devlin et al. (2018).

RoBERTa is a reimplementation of BERT with some key modifications that make it more robust and generalizable. These modifications include:

Training on a larger dataset of text: RoBERTa was trained on a dataset of 160GB of text, which is more than 10 times larger than the dataset used to train BERT.
Using dynamic masking: RoBERTa uses a dynamic masking technique during training that helps the model learn more robust and generalizable representations of words.
Training with larger mini-batches: RoBERTa was trained with larger mini-batches, which allowed the model to learn more efficiently from the training data.
Using a larger byte-level BPE: RoBERTa uses a larger byte-level BPE, which allows the model to tokenize text more effectively.
These modifications have resulted in RoBERTa outperforming BERT on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Model Architecture

The RoBERTa model architecture is similar to the BERT model architecture. It consists of a stack of Transformer encoder blocks. Each encoder block consists of a self-attention layer and a feed-forward layer. The self-attention layer allows the model to learn relationships between words in a sentence, while the feed-forward layer allows the model to learn more complex relationships between words.

The RoBERTa model has 12 encoder blocks, 1024 hidden units per block, and 16 attention heads per block. It has a total of 355 million parameters.

Here is a diagram of the RoBERTa model architecture:

[Input Embedding] -> [Encoder Block 1] -> [Encoder Block 2] -> ... -> [Encoder Block 12] -> [Pooler] -> [Output Embedding]

The input embedding layer converts each word in the input sentence into a vector representation. The encoder blocks then process the vector representations of the words in the sentence. The pooler layer produces a vector representation of the entire sentence. The output embedding layer converts the vector representation of the sentence back into a sequence of words.
